export const DEFAULT_MESSAGE = `Mayor Kevin McDonnell and the Petaluma City Council,

I urge you all to take action to stop the abuses at Perdue’s Petaluma Poultry slaughterhouse, located at 2700 Lakeville Highway within Petaluma city limits. Over the past several years, multiple investigations into Petaluma Poultry facilities, including this slaughterhouse, have uncovered widespread and egregious violations of animal cruelty laws, as well as dangerous pathogens that threaten human health.

The Sonoma County Animal Services Department first alerted local authorities to the company's animal cruelty in 2018, when they referred [1] a Perdue-contracted factory farm in Petaluma to the Sheriff’s Office after examining numerous sick and injured birds removed from the facility on a single day. Over the following five years, investigators with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) made visits to six other Petaluma Poultry-supplying factory farms in Northern California. They documented routine violations [2] of California’s animal cruelty laws, including birds collapsed on the floor or stuck on their backs and unable to walk to food or water, left to slowly starve to death. A 2023 investigation of their slaughterhouse found chickens who had been boiled alive.

In addition to animal cruelty, the public health risks posed by the operations at Petaluma Poultry are profound. As the Press Democrat has reported [3], USDA records from the slaughterhouse show abnormally high rates of Campylobacter and Salmonella, which are known to cause serious foodborne illnesses. The slaughterhouse's own paperwork has also revealed alarmingly high rates of birds with septicemia (a bacterial blood infection). On a single day in April 2023, over 1,000 animals were “condemned” — disqualified from the food supply — due to septicemia. Testing conducted at Petaluma Poultry factory farms in Sonoma County has revealed dangerous pathogens including clostridium perfringens and multi-drug-resistant enterococcus bacteria, both of which can be life-threatening, particularly to vulnerable populations.

In addition to harming animals and public health, Perdue has a long history of mistreating workers, which should not be tolerated in our community. In January 2025, Perdue was ordered [4] to pay $4 million in restitution for illegally employing children in hazardous work at various facilities.

Here in Petaluma, former and current Petaluma Poultry employees filed [5] a class action lawsuit in 2017 against Petaluma Poultry and its parent company Perdue Foods, alleging the company failed to provide workers with statutory 30-minute meal breaks, failed to pay overtime, and violated other wage and labor laws.

Take a stand against animal cruelty, the endangerment of public health, and worker exploitation. Put the safety and dignity of our residents and animals first.

Please call for an immediate investigation into violations of animal cruelty law at Perdue's Petaluma Poultry slaughterhouse. Perdue must be held accountable for violating these laws. Additionally, please use whatever means you have available to shut down operations at the Petaluma Poultry slaughterhouse, including banning slaughter within city limits.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
[Your city]
